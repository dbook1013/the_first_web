<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
    
of a document written in a markup language 
 such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

<p>React can be used to develop single-page, 
    mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. 
    Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering 
 components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries 
  for routing and other client-side functionality</p>
